# Data Engineering Mini Project 11
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a data pipeline using Databricks. It includes one data source and one data sink. The dataset used is a subset of the Million Song Dataset, a collection of features and metadata for contemporary music tracks.

## Steps
1. Create a Databricks workspace on Azure
2. Create a cluster on Databricks
3. Create three notebooks that achieve the functionalities of extract, transform, and load (ETL) workflow.
